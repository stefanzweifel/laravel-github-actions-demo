# Laravel GitHub Actions Demo

A demo application to showcase useful GitHub Actions for PHP developers. This is a companion repository to [this blog post](https://stefanzweifel.dev/posts/2019/06/13/github-actions-for-php-developers-hcl).

Update: This repository has been updated to work with the latest GitHub Actions version. Checkout [this Pull Request](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/laravel-github-actions-demo/pull/2) to learn, how I've migrated from the HCL syntax to the YAML syntax.

You can see how GitHub Actions have been added to this repository in [this Pull Request](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/laravel-github-actions-demo/pull/1).
